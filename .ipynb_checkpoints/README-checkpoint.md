`function?` or `help(function)` gives all information you could need about the method.

Use default settings 

`M, U = choose_default_device(m, r, path)`

Input initialization

r_, phi_ = input_state(r, m, n) 
A = set_input(r_, phi_) 


There are two options for defining the interferometer matrix
`U = get_random_interferometer(m, n_BS)`

or 
`U = import_interferometer(path, file_name)`

After 
`M = set_device_parameters(r, A, U)`
Or 
`M = import_input(path, "/GBS_matrix.dat")`

## Get DataFrame for basis states

```
df_basis = get_basis_df(M)
```

## Generate, export and imput samples

```
batch_size = 10 
samples = uniform_sampling_tr(batch_size,n,m)

export_samples(samples, path, "/samples.dat")

samples = import_samples(path, "/samples.dat")
```

## Compute submatrices according to samples

`submatri—Åes_export(M, samples, path)`

## Compute minors 

`compute_minors()`
compute minors for all samples in `input`

## Compute moments 


there is a class `MomentUtility()` which compute moments from minors up to 4th order for one sample. 
To use it one needs to crete an instanse of the class

`moments =  MomentUtility(id_ = 1, n_moments = 4, path=path) `

where `id_` is the id of a sample, `n_moments` number of moments for computation. (

With export

```
moments.export_moments()

m1_, m2_, m3_, m4_ = moments.get_moments()
```

## Get approximate probabilitie

```
cumulants = CumulantUtility(id_ = id_, n_moments = 4)

probability_approx_2,probability_approx_3, probability_approx_4 = cumulants.prob_approx()
```

### For all samples

```
dict_probabilities = get_approx_probabilities(path) #if you already have submatrices for samples
```
`dict_probabilities` is a dictionary containing unique samples and probabilities for them. 


If you have only samples and want to compute probabilities for them. 

```
dict_probabilities = compute_probabilities(samples)
```
